    <p><b>A proffesional in the warehouse managment field with over 15 years experience in supply chain and leadership.
        Driven and focused with a love for learning and self growth I am now seeking to expand my knowledge and future
        into the world of programming. Technology offers opportunity for creative and logical problem solving, which I enjoy,
        and is also the backbone and future of most every industry currently available with still much growth potential. I desire to be part
        of that opportunity and security that is and will be the foundation of every industry. With AI and ML still relatively new
        there is alot of opportunity yet to be discovered and I believe that programming is the foundation with
        undiscovered potential yet to be seen that I desire to be part of.
