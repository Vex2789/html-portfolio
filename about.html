<h1 style="background-color: darkolivegreen; color: azure;">About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p><b>I enjoy martial arts, philosophy, botany, poetry, art, and nature. 
  I love to learn and have the philosophy of 'experiences over possessions'. 
  Life, to me,is all about experiencing as much as humanly possible.
  You can't take anything with you when you leave this world except who you have become,
  which is made up of your experiences and perceptions.
  I want to experience and learn all I can in this short life and become the best version of myself possible.</p>

<p>I have always been a dreamer and have a fondness for life and the deeper meaning of things.
  Though I am a humble man, I am also a stubborn soul. When I set my mind to something, 
  I have no intention of quiting until I have succeeded or at the least find contentment with my attempt.
</p>

<p>The reason that I want to learn coding is to venture into AI as I beleive that that will be the future.
  I would like to acquire a job for which allows me the ability to travel more.
  If traveling is not in my future, then I hope to make a small difference in the world
   with the knowledge I acquire from learning to code.</b></p>
